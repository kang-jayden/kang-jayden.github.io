I am Jayden Kang, a graduate of the Diploma of Environmental and Marine Science in Republic Polytechnic.
I have spent 5 years exploring Southeast Asian rainforests, studying their ecology and taking plenty of photographs and memories along the way.

This website showcases all my works, particularly my adventures into Remote Sensing and general coding.
